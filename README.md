Frigate is a 2D terminal game coded in C which is similar to the game Battleships. Frigate adds multiple ships of varying types and properties onto the board,
and the user must guess where these ships are by entering coordinates into the terminal. Hits are marked as "h" and misses are marked as "m".
Once a ship is destroyed it will change the board and its corresponding coordinates to its equivalent abbreviation. The game will end upon the user
using up all of their shells, or all ships being destroyed.
